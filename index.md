# Autopilot API & Developer Platform

Welcome to the Autopilot Developer portal. Our goal is to allow you to easily expand the Autopilot platform with
new integrations. This includes adding Autopilot support to your own app, adding support for an external API, or adding something completely new to sell to our Autopilot clients.

<br />
The Autopilot API is still under development, but is mature enough that you can start developing your own apps
if you are interested. Please email us at <a href="mailto:dev@autopilothq.com">dev@autopilothq.com</a> if you
would like early access to the API.

<br />
This documentation portal and all associated links will be updated regularly as we approach the official launch
of the Autopilot API.

### Start Here

* [Getting started guide](/getting-started)
* [API Documentation](http://docs.autopilot.apiary.io/)
* [Create a developer account](/create-autopilot-developer-account)
* [Example apps](/example-autopilot-apps)

### Client Libraries

* [Node.js](http://github.com/autopilotdev/autopilot-client-node)
* [PHP](http://github.com/autopilotdev/autopilot-client-php)

We are currently considering adding support for Swift, Ruby and ASP.NET. Of course, these can all use the 
[Autopilot REST API](http://docs.autopilot.apiary.io/) natively, but we want to make developing on our platform as simple as possible for you.
