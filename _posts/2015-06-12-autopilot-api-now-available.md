Today we sent a newsletter to people who have expressed an interest in Autopilot's API. We have been using our API internally for some time now, and are now excited to open it up to those who wish to use it.

The initial focus on the API is on core features such as adding, changing and deleting contacts, list operations, triggering journeys and being notified when events happen in Autopilot to trigger actions in your own system.

To get started using the Autopilot API please visit the [getting started](/getting-started) section of this website.

We will be updating this Developers Portal regularly with use cases, example applications and other content surrounding our API.
