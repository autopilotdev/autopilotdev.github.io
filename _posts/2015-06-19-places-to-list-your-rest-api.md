After recently publishing the first version of the Autopilot API for marketing automation, I did some research into the best places to list your API to have it discovered by interested developers. Right now, our API is very utilitarian and focuses on the core features that clients need, but in the near future we will be adding features which appeal directly to programmers and I want to make sure that our API is seen by those people.

<br />
There is an advantage in having your API seen before it is used. Many internal company discussions around integrations will hinge on an engineer saying "oh yes I have heard of that API it is good" and you want to be the API they say that about. Making it clear to the web that you have an available API that it is well documented, and that it is well known is a definite way to increase the adoption rate.

<br />
Before you go to list your API, you're going to need the following:

<ol>
<li><strong>A name for your API</strong></li>
<li><strong>A home page specific for your API</strong></li>
"Categories" for your API (this is going to differ per directory but you should have a fair idea how you want to position yourself (for us it is Marketing, Email 
<li><strong>A good description</strong>, ours is:<br />

<em>
<br>
Autopilot is easy-to-use software for multi-channel marketing, it enables marketers to create marketing journeys and convert their leads into customers.

<br />
The Autopilot marketing automation REST API is designed to allow you to integrate your app with the Autopilot platform to create, improve and customize your marketing automation journeys, and improve the data being pushed into your app. Example applications of the API include:<br />

<br />
	• Capturing leads from Autopilot in your own app or CRM<br />
	• Adding contacts from your app or CRM into Autopilot<br />
	• Triggering Autopilot journeys from your app or CRM<br />
	• Keeping unsubscribes in sync between Autopilot and your app or CRM<br />
	• Adding to the Autopilot activity feed<br />
	• Enhance contact profiles with custom fields and data from your app<br />
	• Get data from your app into Salesforce using Autopilot’s deep integration<br />
	• Create your own custom shapes in customer journeys to enhance Autopilot's marketing automation functionality.<br />

</ol>

Here are the main directories I found to list your REST API on. I was surprised by how relatively few there are, but if you know of any that I haven't mentioned, please tweet the [@autopilotdev](https://twitter.com/autopilotdev) account to let us know and I will update this post.

<br />
[APIChangelog.com](https://www.apichangelog.com/)

<br />
This website will list your API and monitor the pages of your documentation to see when they change. Interested subscribers can then be informed any time you update your API. This works really well at Autopilot as we are regularly adding requested features to our API.

<br />
We do keep a mailing list of API subscribers and notify them, but you don't always know who is interested and watching you, and this gives them a great way to follow along without necessarily being on your mailing list.

<br />
[Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory)

<br />
Aside from having a great name, the ProgrammableWeb directory is the largest I have found for listing APIs. Being included there is like being included on the Yahoo! Directory for APIs. Well at least when the Yahoo! Directory was still a thing! Man I am getting old. Anyway, list your API on programmable web for some good traffic and a sense of completeness.

<br />
Here is our completed listing:

<br />
[Public APIs (Mashape)](https://www.publicapis.com/)

<br />
This attractive and simple API directory is written by Mashape, an API documentation tool. I tried using Mashape but found the interface very confusing and restrictive. Apiary is more simple but got the job done for me, even though I don’t like how hard it is to group related API calls together if they have different paths.

<br />
This directory ranks well for API related searches, so it is definitely worth getting a listing on there. They don't ask for a lot of details and they have an option to "Skip the line" by using Mashape, so there's a chance the listing might not even get on there. It takes 5 minutes to register though, so why not.
